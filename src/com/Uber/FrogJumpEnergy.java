/**
 * https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/5817816/Frog-DSA-round-question
 * Given a frog with limited energy capacity standing on a source node. Initially, it has full energy. Moving from one node to another result in a reduction in energy by 1 and an increase in time by 1. There are energy drinks present at some nodes that it can make use of to increase energy. If its energy reduces to 0, it dies. Find the minimum time taken by the frog to reach the destination node. If it is impossible return -1.

 If the frog could move to non-adjacent nodes in a graph, the problem complexity increases, and using Dijkstra's algorithm would become more relevant. Here‚Äôs why:

 When to Use Dijkstra's Algorithm
 Graph Representation: In this scenario, the frog is navigating a graph where nodes represent positions (or states) and edges represent valid jumps, which may not be restricted to adjacent nodes. This makes it necessary to consider various paths, which Dijkstra's algorithm excels at handling.

 Variable Weights: If each edge (the jump between nodes) has a different weight (for example, the energy cost associated with jumping to certain nodes), then Dijkstra's algorithm is appropriate. This algorithm effectively finds the shortest path in graphs with weighted edges.

 Efficient Pathfinding: Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm systematically explores the most promising paths first, making it well-suited for finding the minimum time or energy cost needed to reach a specific node when multiple paths are available. If the frog can jump across non-adjacent nodes with different energy costs, Dijkstra‚Äôs approach ensures that all possibilities are considered optimally.

 Example Scenario
 Consider a scenario where the frog can jump from position
 ùëñ
 i to position
 ùëó
 j where
 ùëó
 j is not necessarily
 ùëñ
 +
 1
 i+1 or
 ùëñ
 ‚àí
 1
 i‚àí1. The cost of jumping from
 ùëñ
 i to
 ùëó
 j may depend on the positions in between or could vary based on energy drinks available at specific nodes

// Adjacent neighbours case (i+1 and i-1). Dijkstra's not needed. A simple BFS would work
//// COnsider the scenario that frog can move one position at a time forward or backward. (For backward case, DFS cannot be used only BFS) Dijkstra's might be an overkill here
