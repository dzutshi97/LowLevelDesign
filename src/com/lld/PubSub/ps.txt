Multitheaded message queue - pubsub
https://github.com/anomaly2104/low-level-design-messaging-queue-pub-sub
I recently appeared for an interview in Uber. The round was machine coding round and they asked me to build a system like kafka where we will have topics and multiple publishers and susbcribers should be able to interact with it without one blocking another.
Idea was to think handle concurrent requests and use multi-threading so that all subscribers can run in parallel.

1. We could have a executor service (thread pool) do publish as well along with subscriber consuming using thread pool
2. If multiple subscribers need to process each message - there are 2 ways
    a) Each subscriber when peeks the message on topic, it will increment offset.
    Once the no of offset is equal to no of subscribers then the message can be removed from queue. -> This is kafka design
    OR better have just a for loop for each subscriber to consume within the code itself!
    b) Any one subscriber can poll from qeuee and process it first. -> pub/sub way?
