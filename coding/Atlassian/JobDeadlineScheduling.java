/**
 * GREEDY Approach:
 * Example with the Allocation Strategy:
 * Consider the three jobs again:
 *
 * Job A: Profit = 20, Deadline = 1
 * Job B: Profit = 30, Deadline = 2
 * Job C: Profit = 40, Deadline = 2
 * Steps:
 * Sort Jobs by Profit:
 *
 * First, sort the jobs by profit in descending order: Job C, Job B, Job A.
 * Schedule Job C:
 *
 * Job C has a deadline of 2. We start by trying to schedule it as late as possible (at t = 2).
 * Since t = 2 is available, we assign Job C to t = 2.
 * Schedule Job B:
 *
 * Job B also has a deadline of 2. We try to schedule it at t = 2, but itâ€™s already taken by Job C.
 * Therefore, we schedule Job B at t = 1, the next available slot before its deadline.
 * Schedule Job A:
 *
 * Job A has a deadline of 1. But since t = 1 is already occupied by Job B, we cannot schedule Job A.
 * Final Schedule:
 * Time t = 1: Job B (Profit = 30)
 * Time t = 2: Job C (Profit = 40)
 * Total Profit:
 * The total profit is 30 (Job B) + 40 (Job C) = 70.
 * Key Insight:
 * By starting the allocation from the latest possible time (the job's deadline), we ensure that we're not unnecessarily blocking time slots that could be used by other jobs with tighter deadlines, leading to a higher overall profit.
 *
 * If you were to start by scheduling jobs as early as possible (from t = 1 onwards), you might end up in a situation where a later job with a high profit cannot be scheduled due to all earlier time slots being filled.
